# Just-In-Time-Compiler

1. **Problem Specification**: Building a programming language for learning compiler workings.
   
2. **Specification of Rules & Attributes**: Defining data types, keywords, syntax rules, comments, operators, and constructs like loops, conditionals, functions, etc.

3. **Specification of Programming Language Constructs**: Covers sequences, selections, and iterations, fundamental for program design.

4. **Possible Techniques to Implement Lexical Analyzer**: Methods like Finite State Automata, Regular Expressions, Table-Driven, or Hybrid approach.

5. **Available Techniques/Algorithms to Implement Parser**: Includes Recursive Descent, LL(k), LR Parsing, Earley Parsing, etc.

6. **Selected Parsing Technique and Application with Examples**: Opting for LL(1) parser for simplicity, efficiency, and predictive parsing capabilities, with examples of its applications.

7. **Description of Errors for Each Phase**: Covers errors in Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, Code Generation, and Linking.

8. **Description of All Semantic Rules**: Encompasses type checking, variable declaration, scope resolution, function calls, memory management, and more, ensuring semantic correctness.

These sections provide a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, language constructs, implementation techniques, error handling, and semantic rules.
